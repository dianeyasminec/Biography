    <p>Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie born on 15 September 1977 is a Nigerian writer whose works include novels, short stories and nonfiction. 
        At the age of 19, Adichie left Nigeria for the United States to study communications and political science at Drexel University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. 
         Adichie is a Catholic and was raised Catholic as a child, though she considers her views, especially those on feminism, to sometimes conflict 
         with her religion.Adichie delivered a talk titled "The Danger of a Single Story" for TED in 2009. It has become one of the most-viewed 
         TED Talks of all time, having amassed over 27 million views.[88] On 15 March 2012, she delivered the "Connecting Cultures" 
         Commonwealth Lecture at the Guildhall, London. Adichie also spoke on being a feminist for TEDxEuston in December 2012,
          with her speech "We should all be feminists". It initiated a worldwide conversation on feminism[dubious  discuss
           and was published as a book in 2014, which has reportedly sold 750,000 copies in the U.S. alone.[80] It was sampled 
           for the 2013 song "***Flawless" by American performer Beyonc√©, where it attracted further attention.
